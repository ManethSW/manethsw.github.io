							Tea tree is one of the most effective ingredients when it comes to skincare, especially when you’ve got oily and acne-prone skin. This powerful ingredient is often found in
							face washes and bath and body products, and is known for eradicating bacteria and germs from the get-go! That’s why it works amazingly well for skin that tends to be a
							minefield for bacteria. Its powers lie in its ability to calm and soothe irritated skin while controlling sebum production.
