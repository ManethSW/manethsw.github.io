            <h2>What is Ceylon Tea</h2>
            <div>
                <p><img src="Images/img1.1.png" id="leaf">Sri Lankan tea known for generations as “Ceylon Tea” is
                    reputed for its’ taste and aroma world over. Sri
                    Lanka is the largest producer of orthodox tea in the world. Currently, Sri Lanka ranks as the fourth
                    largest tea producer in the world. On the global export front, the country is the third largest tea
                    exporter. Sri Lankan tea growers and manufacturers adopt Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good
                    Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and produce tea under the highest social and environmental standards.
                </p>
                <p><img src="Images/img1.1.png" id="leaf">It was during the British era that tea first began to be
                    cultivated and manufactured here. Tea from
                    Ceylon soon gained the reputation of being the finest in the world, and tea exports became the
                    mainstay
                    of the colonial economy. Housewives and restaurateurs across the globe grew familiar with the name
                    of
                    the country, learning that its appearance on a tin or packet reliably guaranteed the quality of the
                    tea
                    inside. Independence brought new markets, and production continued to increase. In 1965 Ceylon
                    became,
                    for the first time, the world’s largest exporter of tea.</p>

                <h2>Tea Production and its' economy</h2>
                <p><img src="Images/img1.1.png" id="leaf">The tea industry exported a total of 228 MnKgs of tea in 2021,
                    fetching for the national economy a
                    revenue of about US $ 1,320 million. In terms of production, Sri Lanka managed to record a figure of
                    300
                    MnKgs last year, which was achieved despite the fertiliser issue hampering the plantation
                    activities.
                    The export and production figures are a significant improvement from what was achieved in 2020,
                    where
                    the export revenue from Ceylon Tea was of US $ 1,213 million and the production was 279 MnKgs.</p>

                <p id="section2p"><img src="Images/img1.1.png" id="leaf">The tea industry in Sri Lanka has played an
                    important role
                    in terms of its contribution to the
                    national
                    output, employment, and net foreign exchange earnings from its inception in 1867. The industry
                    has
                    undergone several changes over the last 150 years. During this period, the ownership of tea
                    lands
                    has
                    changed from privately-owned large-scale tea plantations to nationalized tea plantations managed

                    the

            <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
            <p><img src="Images/img1.1.png" id="leaf">Sri Lanka’s tea cultivators and manufacturers are the
                custodians of the traditional, orthodox method
                of
                black tea production. This is still agreed by most experts to produce the best black tea. Even with
                the
                technological improvements introduced over the last thirty or forty years, the orthodox method is
                relatively slow and labour-intensive; but as the tea planters and traders of Sri Lanka have always
                maintained, good tea cannot be hurried. Nor, oddly enough, can it be delayed. The time devoted to
                each
                of the processes of tea manufacture has to be finely judged if a quality product is to be obtained.
                This
                is a matter of the tea-maker’s judgment, for the right timing depends on the moisture content of the
                plucked leaf, the temperature and humidity conditions prevailing over the period of manufacture, and
                a
                variety of other factors. Although the process of making fine black tea is simple in its essentials,
                expertise, experience, and a ‘feel’ for the task are absolutely essential to success.</p>
