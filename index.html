                <h2>History</h2>
                <p><img src="Images/img1.1.png" id="leaf" alt="bulletpoint as a leaf image">Situated around four kilometers to the south of Kandy, the Ceylon Tea Museum occupies a building that was once the Hatane Tea Factory, constructed in 1925. The tea factory had been abandoned for over a decade before the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, Clifford Ratwatte, incorporated the Ceylon Tea Museum into it in 1998. The Tea Board and the Plantersâ€™ Association of Sri Lanka ensured that the building was refurbished for its new designation as a museum, and it was formally opened to the public on the 1st of December 2001.</p>

                <h2>Why You Should Visit</h2>
                <p><img src="Images/img1.1.png" id="leaf" alt="bulletpoint as a leaf image">The Ceylon Tea Museum houses exhibits on pioneers of the Sri Lankan tea trade, including James Taylor, who was a Scottish tea planter that introduced tea to Ceylon; and Thomas Lipton, another Scotsman who produced Ceylon tea and distributed it to Western markets from 1890 onwards. There are four floors of the museum; on the ground and second floors, visitors can find antique tea-processing machines such as 19th-century generators, rollers, dryers, fermentation tables and sorting machines. The first floor is dedicated to a library and auditorium with audio and visual presentations, while the third floor features a tea store. The top floor is a tearoom with stunning views of the surrounding towns, hills and landscaped tea gardens, and guests can partake in a free cup of tea after going through the tour of the museum.</p>
